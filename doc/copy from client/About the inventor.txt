About the inventor 

It's no coincidence that Jaimyn would invent such a revolutionary fitness product  called Power Trampologa. A humble yet big dreamer, and imagineer , Jaimyn Jupiter always aimed High. Whether it was a big air trick on the skateboard or a thunderous dunk on the basketball court. Jaimyn recalls a time when a football coach offered to pay him  per touchdown if I agreed to come back and play the upcoming season. "Sometimes I think back and say to myself , Dude, what were you thinking , You could have been a famous athlete!" Back then in Charleston , Sc, skateboarding became popular  and this is where Jaimyn learned balance , body control  and mind body awareness. This experience also gave him an edge when he returned to the playing field and in the creative process of developing Power Trampologa. Utilizing his vast fitness experience,  the concept of Power Trampologa was inspired from the need to evolve training techniques that is progressive to all fitness levels with a element if preventative maintenance . " I pride myself in that this device is multidimensional ,  low impact, challenging , fun and can be used for so many different elements of fitness, wellness and preventative maintenance." Power Trampologa makes sense, because the human species must evolve.

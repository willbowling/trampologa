                        <h2>Lymphatic system</h2>
                        <p>This busy network circulates soldier cells to fight infections, filter bacteria, and eliminate parasites and debris from your body. Rebounding is considered to be one of the best forms of exercise to activate the lymphatic system.</p>

                        <p>An estimated 90% of modern day illnesses and symptoms of poor health are lymph related.</p>

                        <p>Treatments are often best stimulated by the activation of lymph circulation. Many headaches, for example can be linked to poor lymphatic circulation.</p>

                        <p>There are over 300 lymph nodes in your neck, head and throat area - more than anywhere else in your body.</p>

                        <p>The function of these lymph nodes is mainly to drain toxins from your brain. If blockages in your lymph become stagnant, toxins are not able to drain efficiently.</p>

                        <p>If toxins move through your liver without being broken down, your body cells in general can become bathed in blood that is toxically charged.</p>

                        <h3>Power Trampologa - About the Inventor</h3>
                        <img class="inventor" src="images/jaimyn-inventor.jpg" alt="About Jaimyn - The Inventor">
                        <p>It's no coincidence that Jaimyn would invent such a revolutionary fitness product called Power Trampologa. A humble yet big dreamer, and imagineer , Jaimyn Jupiter always aimed High. Whether it was a big air trick on the skateboard or a thunderous dunk on the basketball court. Jaimyn recalls a time when a football coach offered to pay him per touchdown if he agreed to come back and play the upcoming season. "Sometimes I think back and say to myself , Dude, what were you thinking , You could have been a famous athlete!" Back then in Charleston , Sc, skateboarding became popular and this is where Jaimyn learned balance , body control and mind body awareness. This experience also gave him an edge when he returned to the playing field and in the creative process of developing Power Trampologa. Utilizing his vast fitness experience, the concept of Power Trampologa was inspired from the need to evolve training techniques that is progressive to all fitness levels with a element of preventative maintenance . " I pride myself in that this device is multidimensional , low impact, challenging , fun and can be used for so many different elements of fitness, wellness, physical therapy, and preventative maintenance." Power Trampologa makes sense, because the human species must evolve.</p>
